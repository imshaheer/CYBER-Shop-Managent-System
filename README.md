# CYBER-Shop-Managent-System
"CYBER SHOP MANAGEMENT SYSTEM" - Second Semester Project
This repository contains the source code for a Cyber Shop Management System implemented in Java. It was my Project for the Second Semester. The system provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing products in a cyber shop.

Features:
1.	Add new products with unique IDs, names, and prices.
2.	Display the list of available products.
3.	Update the details (name and price) of existing products.
4.	Delete products by their ID.
5.	Persistence of product data using file handling.

OOP:
The code is implemented using object-oriented programming principles to ensure modularity and maintainability. It demonstrates the use of classes, objects, encapsulation, file handling, and basic console-based user interaction.

Classes:
The project includes a Product class that represents a product with its attributes (ID, name, and price) and a ProductManager class that handles the CRUD operations and file handling. The main class Main provides a console-based user interface to interact with the system.

File Structure:
The repository contains the following files:
1.	Product.java
2.	ProductManager.java
3.	products.txt: The text file used to store the product information. Each line represents a product and includes the name, price, and quantity separated by spaces.
